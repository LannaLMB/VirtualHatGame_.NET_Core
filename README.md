# VirtualHatGame_.Net_Core
This program is very similar to a previous repository of mine implementing the Virtual Hat Game.  The difference is that this specific project will be built using .NET Core and using Dependency Injection.  This program will allow a user to enter a name into a virtual hat. The user can enter as many names as they'd like. A name cannot be entered more than once. The user can then choose a name from the virtual hat by choosing a number within the range of names entered. The name drawn will then be displayed to the user temporarily.
